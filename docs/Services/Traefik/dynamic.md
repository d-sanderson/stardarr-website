# Dynamic Config

#### AKA External Hosts

There is an example dynamic.yaml file in the Traefik folder that can be used to configure external hosts. This can be useful for routing traffic to other devices on your network.

You will also need to uncomment the respective lines in the compose.yaml file to utilize the dynamic config.
